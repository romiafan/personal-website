          I&apos;m a full-stack engineer focused on building resilient,
          accessible, and high-performance web applications. I enjoy working
          across the stack: crafting cohesive design systems, optimizing API
          layers, and leveraging real-time infrastructure for compelling user
          experiences. My approach balances strong fundamentals with pragmatic
          toolingâ€”always iterating with intention and clarity.
