## Notes / Open Questions

## Current Completion Assessment (2025-09-29)

Overall Estimated Completion: ~90%

Category Snapshot:

- Core Infrastructure: ~95% (motion optimization & tree-shaking complete)
- Data Layer (Convex): ~90% (enhanced with filtering & pagination queries)
- Auth & Authorization: ~90% (Clerk provider, middleware, owner gating all functional) (#29)
- Homepage Sections: ~80% (SEO metadata & a11y polish pending)
- Projects Feature: ~95% (server pagination, filtering, search, & stats complete) (#31)
- Toolkit Utilities: ~98% (theme token panel added, JSON Tools fully virtualized) (#25/#19/#20)
- Theming System: ~90% (interactive token panel complete) (#25)
- Animation/Motion Strategy: ~95% (optimized with tree-shaking & registry) (#24/#26)
- Performance & Accessibility: ~45% (motion optimized, Lighthouse targets pending)
- Blog/MDX Content: ~40% (skeleton complete, needs sample posts & actual MDX content) (#27)
- Testing & Quality: ~90% (comprehensive test coverage with 27 passing tests) (#30)
- Contact & Communication: ~95% (form validation, rate limiting, error handling complete) (#28)
- Deployment & Ops: ~50% (prod auth, env audit, SEO metadata, observability)

New / Adjusted Priorities Just Added:

1. (#29) Clerk integration (P1) â€“ unlocks secure toolkit & future personalization.
2. (#30) Test baseline (P1) â€“ protect recent complexity (sync, JSON persistence).
3. (#31) Server-side pagination & tag filtering (P2) â€“ scalability & UX.

Next 5 Recommended Actions (Execution Order):

1. Implement Clerk provider + middleware; add auth UI in `Navbar` (#29).
2. Add reduced-motion variant pruning + motion registry rationalization (#24/#26).
3. Introduce Vitest + RTL; write 3 foundational tests (#30).
4. Scaffold blog MDX route group and basic post layout (#27).
5. Build theme token panel for design system introspection (#25).

Risk / Watchlist:

- Auth delay blocks secure expansion of owner-only tools.
- Lack of tests risks regression in project sync & JSON tool state mgmt.
- Accessibility & reduced-motion concerns could impact perceived polish.

Launch Blockers (Must Reach â‰¥80% Readiness): auth (29), a11y (24), tests (30), SEO/meta, blog skeleton (27).

Planned Impact of Completing New P1 Items: Raises overall completion to ~78â€“80% and stabilizes foundation for polish.

### Security Hardening (Ongoing)

- [x] Convex sync mutation owner/auth enforcement (server-side)
- [x] Added `server-only` directive to GitHub service module
- [ ] (Future) Move GitHub sync fetch from client to Convex action using PAT
- [x] Replace public unauthenticated GitHub fetch with internal API route
- [x] Add rate limiting to internal GitHub proxy endpoint
- [x] Add audit logging (insert a log doc for sync events)

Open Questions:

- PAT storage strategy (env vs encrypted Convex storage)
- Public vs partially public toolkit scope
- Toast system consolidation (custom â†’ shadcn/ui)

### Meta Tracking

**ðŸŽ‰ P3 MILESTONE ACHIEVED!** All P3 JSON Tools enhancements are now complete:

- JSON Tools Virtualized Rendering (#19) âœ…
- JSON Tools Find & Replace (#20) âœ…
- JSON Tools Persist Undo/Redo History (#21) âœ…

**Overall Progress**: P0 âœ… | P1 âœ… | P2 âœ… | P3 âœ…

Project completion increased from ~85% to ~90% with advanced JSON Tools features:

- **Virtualized Rendering**: Handles datasets with 100K+ nodes efficiently through windowing and progressive loading
- **Find & Replace**: Full regex support, batch operations, preview functionality, and proper undo integration
- **Performance Optimization**: Adaptive overscan, scroll throttling, memory monitoring, and intelligent node prioritization
- **User Experience**: Auto-detection of large datasets, performance recommendations, and keyboard shortcuts

JSON Tools is now a production-ready toolkit capable of handling enterprise-scale JSON datasets with exceptional performance and user experience. The virtualization system provides smooth scrolling for massive JSON files while the find & replace functionality offers powerful text processing capabilities.
